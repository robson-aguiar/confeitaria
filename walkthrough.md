# 🎨 Phase 1 Design Walkthrough

I have successfully implemented the first phase of the "Innovative" redesign, focusing on a premium "Gourmet" aesthetic.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New "Gourmet" Color Palette
Replaced the generic blue/white theme with a sophisticated Chocolate/Gold/Cream palette.
-   **Background**: Cream (`#FAFAF5`) for a softer, more organic feel.
-   **Primary Text**: Dark Chocolate (`#2C1810`) for high contrast and elegance.
-   **Accents**: Gold (`#D4AF37`) for luxury highlights.

### 2. Typography Upgrade
-   Imported **Playfair Display** for all headings. This serif font adds a classic, high-end confectionery feel.
-   Kept **Inter** for body text to ensure readability.

### 3. Cinematic Hero Section
-   Transformed the hero section into a full-screen cinematic experience.
-   Added a "Zoom Effect" animation to the background image.
-   Updated buttons to "Ghost" style outlines and Gold primary buttons.
-   Added a "Hero Badge" (`Artesanal & Premium`) for immediate value proposition.

## Verification
-   **Files Modified**:
    -   `css/style.css`: Updated variables, typography, and hero classes.
    -   `index.html`: Added font links and restructured the hero section.

## Next Steps
-   Proceed to **Phase 2**, where we will implement the realistic 3D configurator.
